<h2><a name=problem1>Problem 1:</a> Assembly Programming Warmup</h2>

<p>This problem introduces the 16-bit LC-2200 assembly language
and has you hand- and machine-assemble a few instructions. </p>

<h3>The LC-2200 Instruction-Set Architecture </h3>

<p><img border=0 src="lc2200-16datapath.jpg" /></p>

<p><b>Figure 1: The LC-2200-16 Datapath (Conceptual)</b> </p>

<p>The LC-2200-16 (Little Computer 2200-16 bits) is very simple, but it is
general enough to solve complex problems. This section describes the
instruction set and instruction format of the LC-2200. The LC-2200 is a
16-register, 16-bit computer. All addresses are word (2 bytes)-addresses. </p>

<p>Although the 16 registers are known as general
purpose registers, they are generally assigned special duties by software convention. </p>

<p>Register 0: This register will always contain zero when read from. As an
additional feature it may be written to in those cases where a value is not
needed. </p>

<p>Registers 1: Although this is a general purpose register by convention, programmers
should not use it. It may be used by the assembler when processing
pseudo-instructions. </p>

<p>Register 2: Is designated as the register used to return values from
functions. </p>

<p>Registers 3-5: Are designated to be used for passing arguments to functions.
</p>

<p>Registers 6-8: Are designated for temporary variables. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: When calling a function the programmer should assume
that the contents of registers 2-8 that were present when the call was made
will no longer be valid. Thus, if needed after the call those values should be
saved by the programmer calling the function. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Registers 9-11: These are saved registers. The caller of a function may
assume that once the function returns the values that were in these registers
before the call will still be there. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Note: This implies that a programmer writing a function that
wishes to use these registers should first save them (most likely on the
activation stack), then use them and then restore them before returning control
to the caller </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Register 12: This register is reserved for handling interrupts. </p>

<p>Register 13: The stack pointer which is used to keep track of the location
of the top of the activation stack. </p>

<p>Register 14: You do not have to worry about this register. </p>

<p>Register 15: When a function is called the JALR instruction will save the
address to return to and by convention this register is used for that purpose. </p>

<h4>Instructions </h4>

<p><em>Instructions are 16 bits wide and require two sequential
fetches from memory.</em> There are 5 instruction formats (bit 0 is the least-
significant bit). </p>

<pre>    R-type instructions (add, nand):

        bits 15-13: opcode

        bits 12- 9: RX

        bits  8- 5: RY

        bits  4- 1: RZ

        bit 0       unused



    I-type instructions (addi, lw, sw, beq):

        bits 15-13: opcode

        bits 12- 9: RX

        bits  8- 5: RY

        bits  4- 0: offsetField (a 5-bit, 2's complement number with

                                 a range of -16 to +15)



    J-type instructions (jalr):

        bits 15-13: opcode

        bits 12- 9: RX

        bits  8- 5: RY

        bits  4- 0: unused (should all be 0)



    S-type instructions (spop):

        bits 15-13: opcode

        bits 12- 2: unused (should all be 0)

        bits  1- 0: control code</pre>

<p>Symbolic instructions should follow the same layout. For example, the add instructions
is written in assembly as: <br />
<code>add &lt;RX&gt;&lt;RY&gt;&lt;RZ&gt;</code></p>

    name for instruction    (bits 15-13)

    ------------------------------------------------------------------

    add (R-type format)     000             Add contents of RY with

     ex: add $v0, $a0, $a1                  contents of RZ, store

                                            results in RX.



    nand (R-type format)    001             Nand contents of RY with

     ex: nand $v0, $a0, $a1                 contents of RZ, store

                                            results in RX.



    addi (I-type format)    010             Add contents of RY to

     ex: addi $v0, $a0, 25                  contents of offsetField

                                            and store result in RX.



    lw (I-type format)      011             Load RX from memory.

     ex: lw $v0, 0x42($sp)                  Memory address is formed

                                            by adding offsetField with

                                            the contents of RY.



    sw (I-type format)      100             Store RX into memory.

     ex: sw $a0, 0x42($sp)                  Memory address is formed

                                            by adding offsetField with

                                            the contents of RY.



    beq (I-type format)     101             Compare the contents of RX

     ex: beq $a0, $a1, done                 and RY; if they are the

                                            same, then branch to the

                                            address PC+1+offsetField,

                                            where PC is the address of

                                            the beq instruction. Keep in

                                            mind that memory is word-

                                            addressed.



    jalr (J-type format)    110             First store PC+2 into RY,

     ex: jalr $at, $ra                      where PC is the address of

                                            the jalr instruction.

                                            Then branch to the address

                                            now contained in RX. Note

                                            that if RX is the same as

                                            RY, the processor will

                                            first store PC+2 into that

                                            register, then end up

                                            branching to PC+2.



    spop (S-type format)    111             Perform the action as

     ex: spop 0                             determined by the control

                                            code (last 2 bits) cc=0

                                            Halt processor
</pre>

<p>Like many processors, an assembler for the LC-2200-16 would supply a number of pseudo-instructions and directives: </p>

<pre>
    halt                                    Simply emits a spop 0
    ex: halt                                i.e. halt the processor

    la                                      Load the address of a label 
    ex: la $a0 somelabel                    into a register

    noop                                    No operation: does nothing
    ex: noop                                (actually emits
                                            "add $zero, $zero, $zero")

    .word (pseudo-op)                       fill that address with
     ex: .word  32                          a given value or label address
     ex: .word  somelabel

</pre>

<p>If a label is used in a beq instruction, it will
evaluate to the PC-relative offset in terms of words. </p>

<p><br />
<strong>A.</strong> <em>[0 points]</em> Play around with the simulator. Try
writing some simple programs to copy numbers from one register to another, to
load and store values in memory, and to get used to the syntax for the
assembler. To use the simulator, extract the tarball, cd into the created
directory, and run "./config.sh". This is a config script that will set up
a Makefile based on your system. If you want to install it, give it paths
for installation; otherwise, just press enter at all the prompts to NOT
install it and just create the executables in that directory. Then run
make to actually build the executables. If you have the Qt libraries installed,
you will get a graphical simulator in addition to the standard text simulator.
The simulator comes with a help option to let you explore its options.</p>

<h2><a name=problem2>Problem 2:</a> Power Test Program</h2>

<p>This
problem has you use the LC-2200 assembly language to write a simple program.<br />
<br />
<strong>A.</strong> <em>[30 points]</em> Define a procedure calling convention
for the LC-2200 assembly language and machine model. The answer should be in
the form of a written specification in enough detail so that one person could
write a procedure (or a procedure call) to be used as part of another person's
program. Use the standard convention as described in class.
Be sure to explicitly address the standard issues:</p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li><em>[10 points]</em> Define how the registers are used </li>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li>i.e. Which are for what? </li>
  <li>Whether the registers are caller or callee saved?</li>
 </ul>
 <li><em>[10 points]</em> Define how the stack is accessed </li>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li>i.e. What does stack pointer point to? </li>
  <li>Which way does stack grow (in terms of memory address)? </li>
 </ul>
 <li><em>[10 points]</em> Define the mechanics of the call, including: </li>
 <ul type=circle>
  <li>What the caller does to initiate a procedure call, </li>
  <li>What the callee does at the beginning of a procedure, </li>
  <li>What the callee does at the end of a procedure to return to the caller and </li>
  <li>What the caller does to clean up after the return from a procedure. </li>
 </ul>
</ol>

<p><br />
<strong>B.</strong> <em>[70 points]</em> Write a function in LC-2200 assembly
language to compute pow(n, m), that is, n raised to the mth power.
(For Example, pow(2, 4) should return 16.</p>

<p>Your function should follow the calling convention that you have outlined above. </p>

<p><b>YOUR FUNCTION MUST BE RECURSIVE!</b></p>

<p>Iterative solutions to this problem will not receive credit!</p>

<p>You must implement recursion using the stack and stack pointer in order to receive
full credit.</p>

<p>If you have questions about how to do this, please post to the newsgroup or ask in
help session. </p>

<p>Make sure that pow.s is in unix-format
and not in Dos/Windows format. Otherwise, you will not be able to assemble it! </p>

<hr size=2 width="100%" align=center>

<h2>Turnin</h2>
<p>Turn <b>ALL</b> of your files into T-Square in a .zip or .tar.gz file:</p>
<ul>
<li>'answers.txt' containing your answers to the first question</li>
<li>'pow.s', containing your assembly code.</li>
</ul>
The TAs should be able to type 'make', './assemble pow.s' './sim pow.lc' and get your answer.
If you can't do this with your submission, you have left something out! You should just re-archive the folder this assignment came in and turn that in.</p>
